# Digitech api

This is a serverless api created for my digitech project

This uses the [usda.gov](https://nal.usda.gov) food info api
You will need to set the APIKEY env variable in order for this work

This was created because small basic can't do JSON formatting and i wanted to do this
It returns the KCAL per gram in the entered food
